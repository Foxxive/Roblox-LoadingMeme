# "If life had loading screens"
Unfinished Roblox meme project based off a TikTok I saw

# What is this?
This is an unfinished Roblox project I started because I saw a funny Tiktok and I wanted to make it an actual game. The reason I never finished it was because I knew that most of these tips would get me banned + I wasn't exactly experienced enough to finish functions that were needed to make the game work. I'm releasing it for the people who are curious to play around with, or to give people a laugh or chuckle.

# Cool, who made the original Tiktok?
@/olgerviks on Tiktok, if you want a direct link to the one that inspired me specifically, here it is:
https://www.tiktok.com/@olgerviks/video/7144896836359245062?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7144896836359245062

# Extra notes
- This includes both the original scripts and instances in the explorer + the entire place file, so if you don't feel like opening studio to view the code, you can view it here.
- If I were you, I wouldn't upload this. If you do you're assuming the VERY HIGH RISK of getting your account banned given how some of the tips may be a little dark-humoured.
- Please don't claim this as your own or try to resell it. It's just wrong and it hurts to see my work plagiarised.

Have fun with this.
